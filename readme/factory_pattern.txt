When developing a payment gateway integration in a PHP application, using design patterns can help structure your code to be maintainable, reusable, and scalable. Here are a few design patterns that are particularly useful:

1. Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern is ideal for implementing payment gateways as it allows you to define a family of algorithms (or strategies), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This means you can easily switch between different payment gateway providers without changing the core logic of your application.

// Define the strategy interface
interface PaymentGatewayInterface {
    public function pay($amount);
}

// Concrete strategy for PayPal
class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGatewayInterface {
    public function pay($amount) {
        // PayPal payment implementation
        echo "Paying $amount using PayPal.";
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for Stripe
class StripeGateway implements PaymentGatewayInterface {
    public function pay($amount) {
        // Stripe payment implementation
        echo "Paying $amount using Stripe.";
    }
}

// Context class to use the strategy
class PaymentProcessor {
    private $gateway;

    public function __construct(PaymentGatewayInterface $gateway) {
        $this->gateway = $gateway;
    }

    public function processPayment($amount) {
        $this->gateway->pay($amount);
    }
}

// Client code
$paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new PayPalGateway());
$paymentProcessor->processPayment(100);

$paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new StripeGateway());
$paymentProcessor->processPayment(150);
